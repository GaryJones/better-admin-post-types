# Better Admin Post Types

If you have a WordPress site with lots of custom post types installed then the admin menu can get pretty congested. Add to that plugins which add their own top level admin menus and the admin area can become a little busy to say the least.

This plugin provides a simple solution as it combines all of the post types on your site under one top level menu item called "Content".
